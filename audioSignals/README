reference_signal.mat is the 1 neuron signal generated by NoiseModelingv1.1, the results are saved in spikes100s_1neurons_2msRP.wav

spikes_2neuron.wav is generated from the data generated by Paul from jneuron. The results were converted to mat, in jneuronSignal/

asymmetricRamp.wav is generated by makeRampSignal.m

IntanTriangle.wav is generated by makeTriangleSignal.m

referenceSignal_100s_1Spike_2msRP is the 1 neuron signals generated by analysis/makeReferenceSignals.m via
NoiseModelingv1.1. The results are converted into 'reference_100s_1Spike_2msRP_<SNR>dB', where <SNR> denotes
the SNR (Gaussian noise).

referenceSignal_100s_2Spike_2msRP is the 2 neuron signals generated by analysis/makeReferenceSignals.m via
NoiseModelingv1.1. The results are converted into 'reference_100s_2Spike_2msRP_<SNR>dB', where <SNR> denotes
the SNR (Gaussian noise).
